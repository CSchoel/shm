  <p>Models the contraction of the heart as described in Seidel's thesis.</p>
  <p>The model takes into account the following effects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There is a refractory period of duration <b>T_refrac</b> after a contraction during which signals of the sinus node are ignored.
    <li>If no sinus-induced contraction occurs for a prolonged time span (namely <b>T_av</b>) the av-node initiates a contraction by itself.
    <li>When a sinus signal is received, the upper heart contracts pumping the blood from the atrium into the ventricles. The systole does only
    begin with the second contraction of the heart. The time period between these two events is called the &quot;atrioventricular conduction time&quot;.
  </ul>
  <p><i>Note: The formulas in this model differ from the formulas found in the c-implementation by Seidel because OpenModelica is currently
  not capable of handling discrete equation systems. Therefore it was necessary to introduce the continuous phases <b>av_phase</b>,
  <b>sinus_phase</b> and <b>refrac_countdown</b>, as well as the continuous variable condition <b>signal_received_cont</b>.</i></p>
